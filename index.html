<body>
    <p>My name is Chinecherem Onovo. I'm a final year student of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, from the department of Applied Microbiology and Brewing. I'm currently on the Stutern Scholarship programme where I'm being taught Software Engineering and it's been a wonderful journey so far, and challenging too. Thank you Stutern and Ingressive For Good for giving me this oppotunity.</p>
